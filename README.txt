The "CAMELS_Sample" folder (provided in "Data" folder) contains precipitation (maurer) data for region 01, streamflow (usgs_streamflow) data
for region 01, and a shapefile of all the CONUS CAMELS basins.

From my report: "The "Regional Linear Regression" script tool performs linear regression models on the CAMELS basins in a specified
hydrological region and can be used with the provided "CAMELS_Sample" folder, with "01" as the specified region."
